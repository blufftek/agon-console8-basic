This text adventure game is a type-in listing from Acorn Programs magazine No. 4 for June/July 1984. The magazine's introduction is as follows:

> "You are about to embark on a dangerous mission. The Princess of Hloria is imprisoned inside forbidding Borgan Castle. Pursued by monsters, spiders and ghosts, you must make your way to the heart of the castle and free her from the clutches of the wicked Jolonians.
>
> "The computer will understand two-word commands such as RUB LAMP or GET BOAT in this absorbing adventure.
>
> "***The Curse of Borgan Castle*** was written for the BBC and the Electron by Steve Lucas of Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire."

This port runs on both the Agon/Console8 and BBC Basic for SDL2, though I've not been able to test it fully as I'm frankly not much good at text adventure games.
