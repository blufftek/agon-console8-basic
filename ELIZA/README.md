Some 40 years ago in a book of BASIC listings I came across a version of ELIZA (although I don't remember it having that name), which I transcribed for the Elektor Junior Computer running KB-9 Basic. No graphics, no colour, no lower case, and designed for use with a serial terminal. The version here is an adaptation of the first example originally developed by Joseph Weizenbaum.

By today's standards it's an absurdly primitive chatbot, but I remember having a lot of fun getting friends and relatives to interact with it. (My aunt, particularly, seemed to regard it as completely genuine and would type lengthy paragraphs in response to the doctor's questions.)

This version runs without modification on BBC Basic for SDL2 and on the Agon/Console8 (VDP1.04 or later). Though set up for 80 columns it will work in 40 columns but some of Eliza's responses may split words across lines.
