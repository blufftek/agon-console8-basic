STUNT DRIVER was originally published in the June/July 1984 issue of Acorn Programs magazine, written by Gary Woolridge.

This is the text of the description:

> "Picture yourself as Evil Knievel in this program by Gary Woolridge, of Handsworth, Birmingham. Using SHIFT to accelerate and RETURN to jump, your aim is to race your stunt car along the ramps and over the barrels. After every successful jump another barrel is added to the row.

> "You have three lives and each barrel you clear without crashing is worth 10 points. Stunt Driver will run on the BBC B or the Electron."

Ported to BBC Basic for SDL2 on an M1 Mac Mini in March 2024. Current version doesn't yet run correctly on Agon/Console8 (watch this space).
