At the beginning of March I set myself a coding challenge to write my own version of John Conway's 𝙂𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙤𝙛 𝙇𝙞𝙛𝙚. A quick visit to Wikipedia to check the rules for the cellular automata, then I fired up 𝘽𝘽𝘾 𝘽𝙖𝙨𝙞𝙘 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙎𝘿𝙇2 on my M1 Mac mini. Rather surprised to find my program actually works.

 The program works on the Agon without modification, but it runs approx 500 times slower than it does on SDL2. One generation every 25 seconds isn't really viable for the 𝙂𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙤𝙛 𝙇𝙞𝙛𝙚, so I may have to resort to assembly for the time-intensive parts of the program (mainly the routines that check if neighbouring cells are alive or dead). I might be able to speed up the BBC Basic code by exploring optimisations (some of which I've already thought of), but I won't get a 25-fold increase, which is what is needed to allow a marginally acceptable rate of one generation per second. On SDL2 the program cycles through approx 20 generations every second. I've included a couple of videos showing the different speeds.
